# Stock-Price-Prediction-Minor-Project-Riya-Tyagi-
Machine learning is used to predict the future value of a company's stock and other financial assets traded on an exchange. The main point of forecasting stock prices is to make large gains. Predicting how the stock market will perform is a hard task to do. There are other factors involved in the prediction, such as physical and psychological factors, rational and irrational behavior, and so on. All these factors combine to make share prices dynamic and volatile. This makes it very difficult to predict stock prices with high accuracy.
## Long Short Term Memory Network
LSTMs work in a three-step process.

The first step in LSTM is to decide which information to be omitted from the cell in that particular time step. It is decided with the help of a sigmoid function. It looks at the previous state (ht-1) and the current input xt and computes the function.
There are two functions in the second layer. The first is the sigmoid function, and the second is the tanh function. The sigmoid function decides which values to let through (0 or 1). The tanh function gives the weightage to the values passed, deciding their level of importance from -1 to 1.
The third step is to decide what will be the final output. First, you need to run a sigmoid layer which determines what parts of the cell state make it to the output. Then, you must put the cell state through the tanh function to push the values between -1 and 1 and multiply it by the output of the sigmoid gate.

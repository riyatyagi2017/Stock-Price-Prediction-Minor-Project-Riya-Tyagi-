Machine learning is used to predict the future value of a company's stock and other financial assets traded on an exchange. The main point of forecasting stock prices is to make large gains. Predicting how the stock market will perform is a hard task to do. There are other factors involved in the prediction, such as physical and psychological factors, rational and irrational behavior, and so on. All these factors combine to make share prices dynamic and volatile. This makes it very difficult to predict stock prices with high accuracy.
